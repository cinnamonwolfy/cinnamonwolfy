Introduction
============

The Remote Login Authentication Protocol is an authentication protocol used to
authenticate a user over the network using a text file as a database,
primarily the password database of a Unix system (however, it can be used as a
wrapper around other file types and protocols (such as SQL)). This protocol
communicates using a server/client paradigm: The client sends login credentials
that are yet to be authenticated, and the server authenticates whatever
credentials it receives.

Packet Layout
=============

A valid RLAP packet always start with ``RLAP`` followed by the role of the
system (``SERVER`` or ``CLIENT``) and the version number of the protocol
(``1.0`` at this time). This would be the header of the packet.

After the header, the packet would contain any of the following: a protocol
command or a data stream.

Protocol Commands
-----------------

Protocol commands are commands that are used in RLAP to control the start and
end of a connection or a data stream. Here is a list of valid commands in RLAP:

* ``RLAP_STARTCONN``
* ``RLAP_ENDCONN``
* ``RLAP_STARTLIST``
* ``RLAP_ENDLIST``

Data Streams
------------

A data stream is a block of data sent by either the server or the client. Its
contents depend on which system sent it (server or client). A client would send
a data stream containing login credentials to the server, and the server would
send a data stream containing authentication results back to the client.

Here's an example:

(Client)::

	RLAP_STARTLIST
	USER nano PLAINPASS system
	USER pocket HASHPASS bupDvZGBBMoBY
	... (more entries)
	RLAP_ENDLIST

(Server)::

	RLAP_STARTLIST
	ENTRY 1 USER YES PASS NO
	ENTRY 2 USER NO
	ENTRY 3 USER YES PASS YES
	... (more entries)
	RLAP_ENDLIST


Example RLAP Packets
====================

(Client)::

	RLAP CLIENT 1.0
	RLAP_STARTCONN
	RLAP_STARTLIST
	USER pocketlinux32 PLAINPASS password
	RLAP_ENDLIST

(Server)::

	RLAP SERVER 1.0
	RLAP_STARTCONN
	RLAP_STARTLIST
	ENTRY 1 USER YES PASS YES
	RLAP_ENDLIST
	RLAP_ENDCONN
